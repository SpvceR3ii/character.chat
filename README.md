# Character.Chat
## "A fully local alternative to Character.AI"

![character.chat logo](images/character.chat-logo.png)

As of the following weeks, character.ai has slowly degraded in quality. It's community is in outrage over new features, filters are going crazy, and more.
Character.Chat fixes that. This is a fully local implementation, a barebones system, of what I've been working on.

## Setup: 
Since most of you don't even care about the backstory, let's get into the basics- Installation!

To build from source (If you're paranoid about the releases), just clone the repo and run `go build ./` in the directory.

For everyone else, download the latest release, and enjoy!

##### This app requires **Ollama**, an AI model loader.

## Roadmap:
- [x] Character Creation Support
- [x] Windows Support
- [x] Multi-LLM Support
- [-] Character Storage 

## Background Information:
*In a galaxy far, far away, a man lay-* Shut up. **NERD!**

This is a really shitty remake of an old system I made in Python, so be warned... the code is ass.

Initially made to revert the changes made with Character.AI's recent updates, this app is packed in with a few features which make it a great competitor.

I'm planning on adding in more, such as automatic updating and enhanced character creation, but it's simply not going to happen until I get better at Golang.

If you find a bug, report it in Eclipse Studios, and that's all from me. Enjoy!
